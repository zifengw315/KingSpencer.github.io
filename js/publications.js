    description: "We introduce EnvHarness, a programmable layer of plug-in components that wraps a static environment to reshape its behavior without modifying the underlying logic while retaining its original verifier. To automate this, EnvRigger observes a target policy's execution trajectories to synthesize harness components targeting its diagnosed flaws. Across five benchmarks in four domains, EnvHarness outperforms both original environments and domain-specific environment-generation pipelines, achieving up to a 9.0-point gain on held-out instances with 9.8% fewer execution steps, and provides a superior optimization signal for reinforcement learning."

The framework introduces Memory-Aware Test-Time Scaling (MaTTS), which creates synergy between memory and scaling—relevant memories guide exploration while scaling generates diverse experiences that improve memory quality.",

The framework reformulates problem-solving as a sequence of logical actions, where models generate internal reasoning and commit to actions. Dense step-wise rewards based on action similarity to expert trajectories provide richer signals than RLVR while allowing reasoning flexibility beyond SFT."
